# Works by Workalaya Documentation

This folder is the documentation home for product and engineering knowledge.

## Sections

- `docs/developer/` — developer setup, architecture, APIs, runbooks.
- `docs/users/` — end-user guides and product usage docs.
- `docs/admin/` — admin/operator guides, policies, and operations docs.

## Writing Rules

- Keep docs close to the audience who needs them.
- Prefer topic-based pages over long monolithic docs.
- Link related docs at the top of each page.
- Update docs in the same PR as code/process changes.
